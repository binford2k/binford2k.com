Community means so much to us that we couldn’t possibly fit all the love into just one event. Our vows will take place earlier in the day and we’re thrilled to continue the celebration with you well into the night.


Vaccinations are expected of all guests. If you aren’t feeling well and need to decline the invite at the last minute, we appreciate your thoughtfulness.

We are a very, very, very liberal couple. We know not everyone in our circle sees the world through the same lenses. We ask that all attending take great care to treat everyone in our chosen family with kindness and respect.
