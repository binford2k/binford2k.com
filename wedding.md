2:15pm until late<br />
Ceremony to begin at 3:00pm<br />
Outdoors at our home in NE Portland<br />

If you are traveling from outside Portland, we’d love to have you join us for a casual happy hour on Friday night too!

Vaccinations are expected of all guests. If you aren’t feeling well and need to decline the invite at the last minute, we appreciate your thoughtfulness.

We are a very, very, very liberal couple. We know not everyone in our circle sees the world through the same lenses.  We ask that all attending take great care to treat everyone in our chosen family with kindness and respect.
