F*ck Cake - we’ve got axes!

We are so excited to celebrate our love with you!  It’s going to be such a fun day in all the weird ways that represent us. 
No cake, BUT axe throwing and improv comedy!!

Saturday, June 24, 2023<br />
At our home in NE Portland (the address is in your email or on the invite) <br />

2:15pm: Grab a cocktail and take some photos<br />
3pm: Ceremony<br />
4pm: Arepa buffet from Teote<br />
5pm: Celtic Axe Throwers truck (ages 13+)<br />
6pm: Open House Reception (more frenz arrive)<br />
7pm: Snacks from Khao Niew<br />
7:45pm: Filbert Improv Comedy Troupe<br />
8:30pm: Toasts<br />

There’ll also be an open bar, a photobooth, yard games, and our house beverage fridge. It’s a very full day - if you need to peace out for a little while and then come back, we totally understand.

Dress as you feel best, but also [dress for the weather](https://www.wunderground.com/calendar/us/or/portland/KPDX/date/2023-6).<br />
Don’t forget some close-toed shoes for the axe truck!<br />

Your presence is the best gift, so don’t worry about bringing anything. We are looking for a few more coolers and some folks to move tables and chairs early-early and late on Saturday.  If you can help, give us a holler.



Vaccinations are expected of all guests. If you aren’t feeling well and need to decline the invite at the last minute, we appreciate your thoughtfulness.

We are a very, very, very liberal couple. We know not everyone in our circle sees the world through the same lenses.  We ask that all attending take great care to treat everyone in our chosen family with kindness and respect.
