title: Backyard Shenanigans
---

As we careen headlong into our second winter of COVID-19, one thing's radically
clear; _we need human contact to save our sanity_. We've built a little backyard
 oasis for the friends we're lucky enough to live by and we'd love if you'd come
share it with us. Keep the weather in mind and dress appropriately. We do have
heaters cranked and sometimes hot drinks, but you should still **dress warmly and
consider a snuggly blanket.** We have beverages to share in the fridge, and you're
invited to bring your own to add to the collective.

## Upcoming Shenanigans

### Ginuary: January 22, 6:45pm

Gin, you say? Yes, gin. Did you know there's a whole flavour palate out there that's
not just xmas trees? We'll have a few fancy-pantsy favorites here, along with some good
old standbys and all the accoutrements for a whole variety of cocktails. Yes, there's
more to gin than just a G&T! Sodas, tonics, berries, citrus, bubbly, other goodies.
And plenty of space to experiment with all the flavors and create all the tiny-but-tasty
cocktails you can imagine.

Anyways, since we're procuring some top-shelf liquors here, we're asking for a $15
  contribution to the cause, which will be your RSVP *(and if that's a burden, just let
us know -- we don't want anyone to miss out on the ginXperience.)*

### Baby, it's dark outside dark beer tasting party: January 29, 6pm

About the only thing that I love more than a big bold dark beer is a whole
taster tray full of big bold dark beers. So we're holding a dark beer tasting in
the backyard this winter. I've got a ton of delicious dark beers, some of which
are really too much for one person to finish in a sitting. And I'd love to share
it with other dark beer fanatics. Bring some of your own too, if you've got
something exotic that you'd like to share. We've got plenty of taster cups to go
around.<br>
*Note: this really is about the beer. If you're not all that into the big heavy brews,
this might not be the event for you. Ping me for details.*

## Backyard rules

Fully vaccinated people only please. This means both initial shots, and the two
week "curing" time after. We don't expect you to have your boosters yet, but
that will probably be the case by springtime.

Kids are currently a grey area, and we'll leave it to your discretion for now.

This is an outdoors space and socially distanced. As such, masks are not
_required_ but are suggested, especially if you're not a regular and this is
outside your extended circle of friends. But that said, we expect each person to respect
others' COVID boundaries and ask for consent before approaching for
a hug or anything else up close and personal. That's a hard
limit.

The bathroom is inside, down the stairs, and to the right. There are sanitizing
supplies and you should wash your hands like the filthy beasts we all are. :)

If we have a signup sheet, it's because we want to either provide the right
amount of food, or because we don't want it to end up too crowded to respect
social distancing. In either case, please update your RSVP if it changes!
