title: Backyard Shenanigans
---

As we careen headlong into our second winter of COVID-19, one thing's radically
clear; _we need human contact to save our sanity_. We've built a little backyard
 oasis for the friends we're lucky enough to live by and we'd love if you'd come
share it with us. Keep the weather in mind and dress appropriately. We do have
heaters cranked and sometimes hot drinks, but you should still **dress warmly and
consider a snuggly blanket.** We have beer to share in the fridge, and you're
invited to bring your own to add to the collective.

## Upcoming Shenanigans

### Single events

* **Friday, November 26**: Does the idea of gorging yourself on food you didn't want to eat with family members you didn't really want to see fill you with dread? Would you rather be doing something athletic, whether it's walking around the block or pounding out a 10k? Come celebrate with us, and at least have a reason for the calories.
  * [Runsgiving Signup Sheet]()

### Recurring Events

* **Sundays**: Would you like your weekends to have a few miles and then brunch with friends? Join the Sunday Runday series. Now with free sticker!
  * [Sunday Runday Calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vaZP-1-Cidej-ZpI9iUCag8tfy696miAw6JF9BaVmnc/edit?usp=sharing)

## Backyard rules

Fully vaccinated people only please. This means both initial shots, and the two
week "curing" time after. We don't expect you to have your boosters yet, but
that will probably be the case by springtime.

Kids are currently a grey area, and we'll leave it to your discretion for now.

This is an outdoors space and socially distanced. As such, masks are not
_required_ but are suggested, especially if you're not a regular and this is
outside your extended circle of friends. But that said, you _will_ respect
other's COVID boundaries, and you _will_ ask for consent before approaching for
a hug or anything else up close and personal. Or you'll leave. That's a hard
limit.

The bathroom is inside, down the stairs, and to the right. There are sanitizing
supplies and you should wash your hands like the filthy beasts we all are.

If we have a signup sheet, it's because we want to either provide the right
amount of food, or because we don't want it to end up too crowded to respect
social distancing. In either case, please update your RSVP if it changes!
