| Many of you know we've had a rough week: our sweet buddy Ruby passed unexpectedly Monday night.  But if you knew Ruben, you know yard parties were some of his favorite things.<br /><br />Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to come spoil Jingle rotten.<br />That's right. We mean cookies. üç™üç™üç™<br /><br />We'll roll back the food menu a little bit (focusing on a yummy baked potato bar), so if you feel inclined to bring a dish to share, it would be appreciated. |

* Appetizers will be served; bring a dish to pass if it makes you happy.<br />
* We'll have some bevs on hand, but please BYOB.<br />
* Costumes are encouraged, but we won't give you TOO much grief if you come dressed as "you..."<br />
* This is an indoor and outdoor party.<br />

As always, feel free to bring guests! We're terrible at getting invites where they should be, so add peeps as you see fit!<br />
