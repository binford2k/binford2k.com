* Appetizers will be served; bring a dish to pass if it makes you happy.<br />
* We'll have some bevs on hand, but please BYOB.<br />
* Costumes are encouraged, but we won't give you TOO much grief if you come dressed as "you..."<br />
* This is an indoor and outdoor party.<br />

As always, feel free to bring guests! We're terrible at getting invites where they should be, so add peeps as you see fit!<br />
