This is the source for my [blog](https://binford2k.com). I started with
[Soot Spirits](https://github.com/abhn/Soot-Spirits) and then customized it by
drastically simplifying some bits and adding some magic of my own. The [tags page](https://binford2k.com/tags/)
started with [jQuery.prettyTag](https://github.com/CodeHimBlog/jquery.prettytag),
which I modified to add the `data-count` attribute and then sized each tag relatively
by this count.

Please feel free to file issues on this project if you find usability concerns
or submit a pull request to correct any content I get wrong.

Thanks!
