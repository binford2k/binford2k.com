# The GINSPLOSION

## Aria Portland Dry Gin
<details>
  <summary>Tasting notes</summary>
  <img src="/assets/images/gins/aria.jpg">
  Aria is full bodied and boldly aromatic. Juniper is up front—obvious on the first nosing and initially on the palate. Underneath the juniper, layers of bright citrus, earthy undertones, floral highlights and subtle spicy notes reveal themselves, both on the nose and palate, though none are overpowering. All of the layers of flavor are balanced. The pristine Bull Run water use to cut Aria after distillation provides a rich, creamy mouthfeel. The finish is long and soft.

  In the southwest, there is first of all the sun. Then there is the sea, then the junipers, with which we make Citadelle Gin. Citadelle is a castle gin made using an open flame Pot Still distillation process.
</details>

## Empress 1908

  <img src="/assets/images/gins/empress.png">
  On top of traditional botanicals, Victoria Distillers adds a signature blend of black tea served at the Empress Hotel and butterfly pea blossom, an exotic herb that balances the traditional citrus notes of gin with a warm herbal earthiness, and gives the gin its natural indigo colour. Empress 1908’s combination of exquisite taste, delicate aroma, soft texture, and remarkable presentation provide the perfect base for a new aesthetic of cocktail creation and enjoyment.

  <img src="/assets/images/gins/freeland_geneva.png">
  Inspired by genever, the Dutch grandmother of gin, Freeland’s Geneva showcases Oregon grown rye with an array of sultry and savory botanicals. A rich grain backbone heightened by peaks of alluring spice and hints of Willamette Valley hazelnuts. Enjoy neat or stirred into a classic whiskey cocktail. Geneva is hand-crafted grain to glass in Portland, Oregon.

  Rich layered rye and buckwheat with undertones of hazelnut, juniper and spice with a lengthy and contemplative finish.

## Freeland Dry Gin

  <img src="/assets/images/gins/freeland_dry.jpg">
  Freeland Spirits Dry Gin is a London Dry-style dry gin distilled in Portland, Oregon. For all you rebels defying the odds and breaking through the glass ceilings, we created a Navy Strength Gin, because strong gals deserve strong gin. The aromatics are concentrated and bold, tickling the senses with hints of spice, citrus peel, and the ever present juniper berry. Our women owned and operated distillery offers the best of the Pacific Northwest in every sip.

  Leads with juniper and is backed up with notes of pine forest, mulled spices, green olive and a hint of citrus.

## Freeland Gin

  <img src="/assets/images/gins/freeland_gin.png">
  Freeland Spirits Gin is small batch crafted using a unique blend of traditional heat distillation along with vacuum distillation, which allows us to use fresh, Pacific Northwest ingredients. Fresh herbal essences of rosemary, mint and crisp cucumber lift the nose. Grapefruit and lemon peel brighten the brisk juniper and bold spice. Pink peppercorn, coriander and star anise mingle with 10 additional dried botanicals in the copper pot still.

  Layered spice balanced by freshness, strikingly smooth texture, rounded body.
</details>

## Grey Whale
<details>
  <summary>Tasting notes</summary>
  <img src="/assets/images/gins/grey_whale.jpg">
  Citrus, with lemony notes, hints of mint and evergreen inspired pine. As it sits, a warming, earthy nuttiness begins to emerge. A faint nuttiness with gentle echoes of mint on the entry. Pine-forward juniper mid-palate echoes both juniper and fir needles. Slightly sweet, the botanicals evoke a texture and richness to the palate.

  A good suggestion is to take any vodka cocktail recipe and replace the vodka with Gray Whale Gin. Suddenly, your tasteless cocktail is interesting.

## Monkey 47
<details>
  <summary>Tasting notes</summary>
  <img src="/assets/images/gins/monkey47.jpg">
  Fresh and fruity, with a lot of complicated nuance. There’s two levels on which you can enjoy this spirit: firstly, you can just appreciate the way it blends together to create a single powerful presence. Secondly, you can sit down as if to study it and probe the way this myriad of botanicals unravel on your palate.

  The palate starts with some minty, herbal notes. Herbaceous juniper, blackthorne, lavender and an acute resiny pine note that comes across as more spruce/rosemary. As the taste progresses, we get peppery, vegetal notes, harmoniously entwined as if a single botanical.

## New Amsterdam Stratosphere

## Two James Old Cockney
<details>
  <summary>Tasting notes</summary>
  <img src="/assets/images/gins/two_james.png">
  Old Cockney is a contemporary style gin crafted from a base of organic winter wheat. The botanical blend of coriander and orange peel provide nice floral and citrus aromas and flavors, which are balanced by spice from black peppercorn and earthy elements from orris root, angelica root and gentian root. Our gin possesses heavy juniper, but pine notes serve as an undertone in the flavor profile. The result is a dry, smooth gin with a unique but harmonious balance of flavors—a true cocktail connoisseur’s gin.
