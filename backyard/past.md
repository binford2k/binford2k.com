### Marshall Fire Benefit Concert: February 28, 6pm

 A coworker and friend lost her home to the devastating wildfires in Colorado. This
 concert proceeds (including service fees) will go directly to The Marshall Fire Benefit
 to support her and others in that unfortunate situation. The show will feature a ton of
 of artists, such as the Lumineers, Michael Franti, Lake Street Dive, a bunch of
 Colorado-based artists and more.

 We'll watch from the backyard, but if you'd like to contribute, you can [buy your own
 tickets for as little as $10](https://marshallfirebenefit.veeps.com/events/75be192f-339f-4bea-9b95-dc6a40786113).


### Baby, It's Dark Outside dark beer tasting party: January 29, 6pm

 About the only thing that I love more than a big bold dark beer is a whole
 taster tray full of big bold dark beers. So we're holding a dark beer tasting in
 the backyard this winter. I've got a ton of delicious dark beers, some of which
 are really too much for one person to finish in a sitting. And I'd love to share
 it with other dark beer fanatics. Bring some of your own too, if you've got
 something exotic that you'd like to share. We've got plenty of taster cups to go
 around.<br>
 *Note: this really is about the beer. If you're not all that into the big heavy brews,
 this might not be the event for you. Ping me for details.*

### Ginuary: January 22, 6:45pm

 Gin, you say? Yes, gin. Did you know there's a whole flavour palate out there that's
 not just xmas trees? We'll have a few fancy-pantsy favorites here, along with some good
 old standbys and all the accoutrements for a whole variety of cocktails. Yes, there's
 more to gin than just a G&T! Sodas, tonics, berries, citrus, bubbly, other goodies.
 And plenty of space to experiment with all the flavors and create all the tiny-but-tasty
 cocktails you can imagine.

 Anyways, since we're procuring some top-shelf liquors here, we're asking for a $15
   contribution to the cause, which will be your RSVP *(and if that's a burden, just let
 us know -- we don't want anyone to miss out on the ginXperience.)*
