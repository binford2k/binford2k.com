Ruben knows all about cabin fever - and he shakes them off with a few good front
yard zoomies! Come join his humans while they do their own zoomies around the
neighborhood!

Walk, bike, skate, scoot, run - you choose. We've got four 5k loops mapped out
for you to pick your own distance; 5k, 10k, 15k, 20k!

Semi-supported:
* Four 5k loops with our house in the center.
* Water and electrolytes available at the house.
* The bathrooms at the house will be open!
* Post run nibbles to include bananas, bagels, peanut butter, etc.

## Route(s)

We've combined four 5k loops to make the full run. You can choose which to run
and which order to run them in.

Quick tip; you can see the elevation profile of each loop on the Google map
by expanding the section on the left bottom, underneath the route distance.
They all say "mostly flat," but trust me, they lie.

Clockwise from the top left, we have:

1. The Concordia Loop
    * This is similar to what many of us run for our Run Club loops. Start at the house, jog over to
      Alberta Ct. at KÊ°unamokwst Park. Out to 34th and loop back on Killingsworth. Bring it home on
      57th. Don't be surprised by that little hill, it's a doozy!

1. The Cully Park Loop
    * This loop heads out to Cully Park, which Ruben will love. You may need to dodge people or adapt
      as needed because the park will probably be fairly busy.
    * Turn right out of the driveway, then another two quick rights to get onto Alberta heading out to 72nd.
    * Turn left to get to the park. 72nd is not typically very busy, but note that a short section
      has **NO SIDEWALKS** so do watch for cars.
    * Bear to the right as you enter the park, then head straight out for a loop around the soccer
      field. See the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/zoomies_cully.png" title="Cully Park loop" class="lightbox">satellite view</a>
      to better understand the loop.
    * On the way back, you'll hang a right onto Emerson and then sneak through a mid-block cute little
      alley to get from Emerson to Sumner and back out to Cully. Stay on the left side for a block,
      then cross at the crosswalk and head to 60th where you'll run on the right side in the
      separated pedestrian pathway.

1. The Roseway Loop
    * This loop has you jaywalking across Cully and out to 72nd again. You can totally cut the grassy
      corner if you want.
    * You'll take 72nd all the way up to Fremont, but as you cross Prescott, be very careful with the
      stretched out five-way intersection and make sure that all the drivers see you before you cross.
    * On the way up the hill you can run either in the park or on the sidewalk on the right side of 72nd.
      Turn right on Fremont and again on 60th/Cully and descend.
    * When you get to the bottom, in front of AutoZone, cross the street to get to the Speedway gas
      station, then cross again to get to the 7-11. Yes, it's annoying (pro-tip; if you'd rather cross
      at the top of the hill, that's totes ok too.) See the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/zoomies_prescott.png" title="Navigating the Prescott intersection, showing both the Roseway and Wilshire loops" class="lightbox">satellite view</a>.

1. The Wilshire Loop
    * This starts similarly to the Concordia Loop, but you'll jog left to get onto Going. Cross 42nd, then
      turn left and climb to Fremont St.
    * **Here you should turn *right***, then stop immediately and cross Fremont and turn left again. This
      gets you on the less busy side of the street. See the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/zoomies_fremont.png" title="Navigating the turn onto Fremont" class="lightbox">satellite view</a>.
    * Run to 60th, but don't cross the street. Turn left and zoom down the hill on the *left* side. At
      the bottom, cross to the 7-11 and head back to the house.
    * 89 foot elevation change
