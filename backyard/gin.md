# The GINSPLOSION

Gin is wonderful on its own. Ice cold on the rocks, or neat at room temperature. Do try some on their own to get a good
idea of the base flavours you'll be working with.

But when you do start mixing in the accoutrements, the secret is the interplay between complements and contrasts. For
example, a citrus-forward gin like New Amsterdam doesn't need more citrus... but what contrasting flavor could highlight
and compliment it? On the other hand, with a light and floral gin, you want to be careful not to overpower it, so you
might choose a more subtle complementing flavor to enhance the floral notes.

We have a whole variety of ingredients, ranging from spicy, to sweet and fruity, to citrus, to herbal, and savory. A
good strategy might be to pick a palate of two of those, then select one ingredient to represent each. As you get more
adventurous, you can try more complex combinations.

Some examples could be:

* Sweet and spicy; raspberries and peppercorns
* Citrus and herbal; lemon and mint
* Fruity and savory; blueberries and sage

There's more to gin than just tonic. But that's a good place to start. Remember that a good old G&T is mostly tonic, so
make sure to pick something that will bring out the flavors you've chosen. Sip some of the different choices and see what
you like. And if you're not a fan of the mediciney flavor of quinine, there's nothing at all wrong with plain seltzer.

Once you're ready to branch out, experiment with some other combinations or recipes. A greyhound is gin with grapefruit
juice; an orange blossom is gin with sweet vermouth and orange juice; Aria gin would go really well with Earl Grey black
tea and a lemon slice. And let's not forget the fabulous French 75 which pairs some nice bubbly champagne with gin and
a good squeeze of lemon.

If you're aiming to impress, you can make the gorgeous Sparkling Elderflower with the Empress 1908. Add heavy splashes
of lime and elderflower syrup, then top with tonic and a few mint leaves.

Get funky with it and share the recipes to your favorite creations!

## Aria Portland Dry Gin
<details>
  <summary>Tasting notes</summary>
  <img src="/assets/images/gins/aria.jpg">
  Aria is full bodied and boldly aromatic. Juniper is up front—obvious on the first nosing and initially on the palate. Underneath the juniper, layers of bright citrus, earthy undertones, floral highlights and subtle spicy notes reveal themselves, both on the nose and palate, though none are overpowering. All of the layers of flavor are balanced. The pristine Bull Run water use to cut Aria after distillation provides a rich, creamy mouthfeel. The finish is long and soft.

  Warm and woody with a hint of spice and notes of juniper turned up just right, Bourbon Barreled Big Gin is crafted for the curious. It's rested for 6 months in once-used bourbon barrels from Heaven Hill Distillery, so their flagship is enriched with flavors of vanilla, charred oak and tannins.

  Bourbon Barreled Big Gin will highlight the smokiness of grilled dishes. Try it with salmon or pork, and grilled garden veggies like carrots or asparagus.

  <summary>Tasting notes</summary>
  <img src="/assets/images/gins/empress.png">
  On top of traditional botanicals, Victoria Distillers adds a signature blend of black tea served at the Empress Hotel and butterfly pea blossom, an exotic herb that balances the traditional citrus notes of gin with a warm herbal earthiness, and gives the gin its natural indigo colour. Empress 1908’s combination of exquisite taste, delicate aroma, soft texture, and remarkable presentation provide the perfect base for a new aesthetic of cocktail creation and enjoyment.

  Freeland Spirits Gin is small batch crafted using a unique blend of traditional heat distillation along with vacuum distillation, which allows us to use fresh, Pacific Northwest ingredients. Fresh herbal essences of rosemary, mint and crisp cucumber lift the nose. Grapefruit and lemon peel brighten the brisk juniper and bold spice.

## Grey Whale
<details>
  <summary>Tasting notes</summary>
  <img src="/assets/images/gins/grey_whale.jpg">
  Citrus, with lemony notes, hints of mint and evergreen inspired pine. As it sits, a warming, earthy nuttiness begins to emerge. A faint nuttiness with gentle echoes of mint on the entry. Pine-forward juniper mid-palate echoes both juniper and fir needles. Slightly sweet, the botanicals evoke a texture and richness to the palate.

  A good suggestion is to take any vodka cocktail recipe and replace the vodka with Gray Whale Gin. Suddenly, your tasteless cocktail is interesting.

## Monkey 47
<details>
  <summary>Tasting notes</summary>
  <img src="/assets/images/gins/monkey47.jpg">
  Fresh and fruity, with a lot of complicated nuance. There’s two levels on which you can enjoy this spirit: firstly, you can just appreciate the way it blends together to create a single powerful presence. Secondly, you can sit down as if to study it and probe the way this myriad of botanicals unravel on your palate.

  The palate starts with some minty, herbal notes. Herbaceous juniper, blackthorne, lavender and an acute resiny pine note that comes across as more spruce/rosemary. As the taste progresses, we get peppery, vegetal notes, harmoniously entwined as if a single botanical.

  Old Cockney is a contemporary style gin crafted from a base of organic winter wheat. The botanical blend of coriander and orange peel provide nice floral and citrus aromas and flavors, which are balanced by spice from black peppercorn and earthy elements from orris root, angelica root and gentian root.
