Many of you have already heard that there will be no more Hammy Fridays. Hambone
passed away in my arms on New Years Day. He struggled with a heart condition and
seizures for years. If you've been around us much, I'm sure that you've noticed
that lately he was often being carried instead of running. When he caught
pneumonia it was just too much for his little body to handle.

He will be missed dearly. He was our best little buddy and brought so much joy
into our lives. This month is his six year anniversary with Puppet, so he's been
with the company for half of his life. Coming into the office was one of his
many joys. He somehow knew how to count seven days and every Friday he'd run in
circles and make his little excited gremlin sounds. If I took too long to get
ready, he'd bump my ankles with his head to urge me towards the door.

He loved sharing his life and happiness with all of you. One of Hammy's other
favorite places was [Bushwhacker Cider](http://www.bushwhackercider.com/). He
loved coming in for run club and hanging out at the bar with Emily. We will be
having a Hammy Hour [there](https://goo.gl/maps/Lkyen4UYdRy) Friday (tomorrow)
after work if you'd like to say goodbye. They are totally dog friendly, so
bring any furry ones who loved him like we do.
