Just a friendly PSA that Puppet 3.x reached its end of life <b><span id="warning">on December 31, 2016</span></b>.
I suggest upgrading to an LTS release for access to bug fixes and security updates
after December 31, 2016.

If you have not yet updated, you should make that a priority!

***Update:**

* As of October 2018, Puppet 4.x is also EOL.*
* As of February 2021, Puppet 5.x is also EOL.*

* [Learn more about the support lifecycle policy](https://puppet.com/misc/puppet-enterprise-lifecycle)
* [Upgrading to Puppet 4](https://docs.puppet.com/upgrade/upgrade_steps.html)

<script>
    var eol  = new Date(2016, 11, 31, 23, 59, 59);
    var days = Math.round((new Date() - eol) / (86400000));

    $("#warning").html(days + " days ago");
</script>
