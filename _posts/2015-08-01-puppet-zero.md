Configuration management with tools like [Puppet](http://www.puppetlabs.com/)
can make your life a lot easier.  It can make configuring newly provisioned
servers more repeatable and reliable and it can make disaster recovery nearly
trivial. Learning to use the tool isn't trivial by any means, though. There are
200 configurable options, give or take depending on the version you're running,
and the number of things you can do with it is nearly infinite. You can
structure your code any way you want, so how do you know what's the "right" way,
and what about modules from the [Puppet Forge](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/)?

I can't take away all the complexities, but what I can do is introduce you
gradually in a way that helps you to absorb new information. This blog series is
designed to take a user from their first sight of Puppet to proficiency. So
let's get started. The simplest way to do this is either by downloading the
[Puppet Labs Learning VM](https://puppetlabs.com/download-learning-vm) or firing
up a VM of your choice and installing the [Puppet Enterprise free
trial](https://puppetlabs.com/download-puppet-enterprise).

All ready? Click to the next article and let's get started! Navigate through the
series with the links at the bottom left & right of the articles.
