Geppetto is an Eclipse-based IDE for developing Puppet modules. The editor
provides features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, error
highlighting, refactoring, and even integrates directly with the Puppet Forge.

Geppetto is incredibly powerful and feature packed, but like many powerful tools
it can tend to be complex and favor software developers over those using
Geppetto to maintain the Puppet modules used to manage their infrastructure.
We'd like a workflow that lets you quickly and easily update, test, and then
deploy modules directly from your workstation. We'd like to use the New Project
wizard to create new modules with all the expected metadata files in place and
we'd like to have the option of publishing them to the Forge.

This tutorial describes how you can configure Geppetto for this style of
development and a useful workflow for maintaining and updating your in-house
Puppet modules. Unfortunately, some of the steps are still manual, but we will
configure shortcuts for as much as we can. For simplicity, we will assume that
you have some form of git server running on your Puppet Master, allowing you to
easily create new repositories as needed with the proper hooks in place to keep
the code in your Puppet modulepath updated.
