I'm just your average beer & coffee drinking software developer and sysadmin in
Portland, Oregon. When I told people I was moving here, nobody was surprised.
This may have something to do with the toe shoes. I'm a Developer Advocate at
[Puppet](https://puppet.com), which basically means that I know how to talk to
developers outside the company and to developers inside the company and I can
help them to be friends with each other. I get to play with all the cool new
tools and help others learn how to do it for real.

When I started here, I was in professional services, which meant that I visited
exotic places like Denver and Columbus and teach people to use Puppet1 or help
them integrate it into their infrastructure. Now most of my travel is to blab
at conferences and such.

Oh, and I run marathons in those funny finger shoes. This is destined to one day
be the online home of my consolidated projects and writing. Someday.
